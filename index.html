    Steven Millward: China might have a very well established web industry, but it’s still a rough ride for Chinese startups. There’s little in the way of government support like you’ll find in nations like Singapore, and there are strong web portals and companies out there that could easily and quickly clone a startup’s key product. In fact, you’re more likely to be copied than acquired. And when it comes to the government, you’re more likely to face troubles and restrictions than get solid support. Right now, taxi booking apps are flourishing – but then authorities have already begun to regulate or even ban these apps in some cities. What recourse do these startups have? None.

On the more positive side, there’s a great startup ecosystem from the idea stage right up to major follow-up funding. At the base are startup events like Startup Weekends and Barcamps in cities like Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai occurring very often. It would be nice to see more in the way of startup contests (like TechCrunch Disrupt or our own Startup Asia events) that can give local startups a visibility boost. Or a cash boost for the winners. The annual GMIC Beijing event does do that, but more pitching and contest chances would be good.

At the funding level, there are strong funding interests in China from a wide variety of sources, which makes it not too vast a challenge to get funding for a successful enterprise. Interest in e-commerce seems strongest, with anyone from Sequoia Ventures to GGV Capital to California’s Bluerun Ventures being especially keen on innovative e-stores. Social is a tougher area – hard to monetize, and easy to copy – for all but a few lucky ones. With e-commerce in China set to be worth a total of $177 billion in 2013, it’s little wonder that a lot of startups are trying out this business avenue.
For incubation and acceleration, the largest is Innovation Works, created by Taiwanese-American Lee Kaifu, which is incubating over 50 startups that are now estimated to be wealth over $600 million. It can do series A funding as well as seed-stage. Aside from that, there’s Tisiwi in Hangzhou, and the soon-to-be-rebranded Chinaccelerator up in Dalian.

      <p>Anh-Minh Do: Of course, Japan is one of the more mature markets in the region, and it’s got big influential hits that shape the region. The center of all the activity is in Tokyo. But gone are the days when big guys like Hitachi, Sony, Fujitsu, and Panasonic are the rising stars (with Japan struggling economically, and hardware alone being less of a factor for consumers) and new players are on the scene now, with folks like GREE, DeNA, and Rakuten looking increasingly global and influential. If you want a quick look at the local scene, take a click over to our friends at Startup Dating and you’ll see a particularly vibrant ecosystem of business, VCs, and incubators.
        On top of the big startup successes, Japan’s education system is particularly supportive, with incubators like Open Network Lab attempting YC-like startup acceleration. You can check out a full comprehensive list of incubators and accelerators in Japan here.

        On the other hand, the problems that Japanese startups face are difficult: a relatively low-risk culture, with high rent costs, and a small ecosystem. But despite all this, big successes do manage to peek through and the government has been very supportive in setting up incubators – there are more than 300 across the country today.
