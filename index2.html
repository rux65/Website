                     With Alphabet recently announcing plans to gentrify Toronto’s dilapidated quayside with a futuristic micro city, the global tech industry is making a bold statement in Canada’s most populous city. With 22,500 digital jobs created in 2017, Toronto has been flexing its microchip muscles for some time.<br><br>
          Although it’s very much still in its growing stages (reflected in the relatively low wages in comparison to the rest of North America), Toronto’s tech scene already hosts leading research centres in the likes of data science, AI and even stem-cell research. With high living standards and affordable rent costs, this growth is surely only set to continue.

                      The Vancouver startup scene is as active as its outdoor adventure scene. It’s young, innovative, energetic, supportive, and growing — fast. According to a recent study, the city boasts over 68,000 tech workers, which is up 30 percent from last year. Hootsuite, D-Wave, Build Direct, Indochino, Freelancer, Vision Critical and hundreds of other startups call Vancouver home. Overall, the city ranks as the 15th best startup ecosystem in the world. Companies like Apple have taken notice of the local innovation and even acquired promising startups like Buddybuild. Vancouver is one of the global leaders in cleantech with over 50 companies employing 7,700 people. It’s the biggest hub for gaming in the country and houses EA’s largest studio, Capcom, and Nintendo as well as homegrown successes like Eastside Games and A Thinking Ape. On the new and buzzworthy side of things, Vancouver is starting to make a name for itself in the Blockchain space. Current Vancouver resident, Bluescape engineer, and Terminal Member Jordan Zhang says there is a grassroots approach to Blockchain in the area that is energizing and cites DCTRL as a great example. The Bitcoin co-op is member-supported and leased space in the basement of a downtown barbershop where people meet, code, and explore the potential future of cryptocurrency. DCTRL represents the kind of unforced, organic explorations and thought leadership that made Silicon Valley what it is today.

					  To put it simply, Silicon Valley is the original tech mecca. Since the 1930s, it has been home to the biggest tech companies in the world, attracting some of the most innovative minds on the planet, and much of the technology that was created and developed there continues to heavily influence the way we all live. For tech professionals, Silicon Valley is the summit and the tech hub to which all other tech hubs are compared.

					  With many tech professionals looking for an alternative to the aforementioned rent issue in Silicon Valley, the ‘Silicon Hills’ of Texas are seemingly fitting the bill; office space is increasingly being snapped up by both startups and established firms, with funding – and talent – not far behind, either.
					<br><br>
          To suggest that Austin is piggybacking on Palo Alto’s problems would be grossly unfair, though. The city has built up a hugely impressive tech reputation all by itself, thanks in part to homegrown companies like Dell, as well as the presence of the hugely popular annual South by South West (SXSW) music/tech festival. Indeed, with new jobs being created every day and an abundance of affordable living spaces available, there is nowhere more exciting in the US to be a tech professional right now.

<p>
					 Although Boston was slightly behind the times during the original internet boom, the city has finally caught up with its tech counterparts in California. Of course, having two of the finest educational institutions in the world (MIT and Harvard) in its backyard undoubtedly helps.
<br><br>
          Either way, the area is now seeing some returns on this talent pool in the tech sector, with HubSpot, TripAdvisor and Wayfair all recent startup success stories. In general terms, though, it’s Massachusetts’s position as the country’s top tech employer that offers the most encouragement, with better living costs and a vibrant city lifestyle providing a viable alternative to the likes of Palo Alto.

					  There’s no arguing about it: Miami belongs to Latin America as much as it belongs to the US. In this context, it is hardly surprising to see startups open offices in Miami to target the Latin American market. To give only a couple of examples, this is the case of two companies we have reviewed over the last few months: the language learning platform OpenEnglish and the music service Senzari.
<br>
Interestingly, the connection also works the other way around. As the Miami-based angel investor Marco Giberti pointed out in the interview we published recently, targeting the US Hispanic market can be a good strategy for Latin American startups to crack the US market, and Miami a good starting point for US expansion.
<br>
In other words, Miami is a powerful bridge between the US and Latin America – and New York City will have to keep up its efforts if it wants to challenge this position.

					  As we reported, Recife has long established itself as a talent pool for the global tech industry, thanks to its universities’ world-class computer science departments. Over the last decade, the city has also been working on ways to retain this talent and stop the brain drain, while attracting foreign professionals.
<br><br>
The key to accomplish this goal is called C.E.S.A.R, which is the Brazilian acronym for “Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems.” Created 15 years ago by university teachers, it has turned into Brazil’s most innovative tech institution. In addition to helping big companies develop new ideas through open innovation, it also incubates its own startup projects, such as green tech company Silicon Reef.
<br><br>
More recently, C.E.S.A.R has also become part of a larger initiative, the tech cluster Porto Digital, which plays host to 143 companies and 6,500 IT professionals. If this wasn’t enough to put Recife on the map, the city also recently hosted a Startup Weekend, and is now gearing up for its Campus Party.

					  Rio de Janeiro is not only one of the most naturally beautiful cities in the world; it is also becoming a serious São Paulo challenger when it comes to Internet startups. While Rio’s natural assets aren’t new, the city has been increasingly attracting attention over the last few months.
<br><br>
More importantly, this trend is likely to persist at least until 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. As a result, Cisco chose Rio as the base for its new innovation center, which is part of its $570m investment in Brazil, while IBM is helping Rio’s city hall to manage its impressive operations center.
<br><br>
Yet this isn’t only about happy accidents, and local forces have also made considerable efforts to give the city’s tech scene a boost. New and high-quality accelerators have emerged, such as 21212, which also has offices in New York, but also 100% Rio-based Polo Marte, VentureOne and Startup Rio – not to mention other initiatives that are currently in the works.
<br><br>
In addition to Startup Weekend, regular networking events have also blossomed, for instance Startup Rio Meetup, which has expanded to other cities, as well as Geeks on Beer, which is organized by the same group which is also managing Rio’s main co-working space, BeesOffice.

					  It is no accident that we chose São Paulo as the destination for the first TNW Conference Latin America next August. As the research firm Fnbox reported, the GDP of the state of São Paulo is bigger than Argentina’s, Chile’s, Uruguay’s, Bolivia’s and Paraguay’s combined, despite the fact that it is less than 5% the size of those countries.

In this context, São Paulo is arguably the place to be for startups keen to tap its huge local market or use it as a base to target Brazil in its entirety, while partnering with the vast number of local and foreign companies which have offices in this huge city.
<br><br>
It is also the best location to raise money from its many investors and banks, as well as from foreign VC funds such as Sequoia and Flybridge, which tend to choose the city as their point of entry into Latin America. In addition, the city also hosts a vast number of networking events and hackathons, as well as several co-working spaces.
<br><br>
As a result, São Paulo has one of the busiest startup ecosystems of Latin America, and there are way to many promising startups to name them all – but you will definitely get a chance to meet them at TNW Conference.

				The UK -- and London in particular -- continues to be the top European hub for tech investment and innovation, even if the clouds are gathering on the horizon.

According to figures from London & Partners, the capital's tech firms accounted for over 80 percent of all venture capital money invested into the UK since the country voted to leave the European Union. Despite fears that investment would collapse after the leave vote, UK tech companies have received over £5 billion in VC funding since June 2016. That's more than France (£1.55bn), Germany (£2.15bn) and Sweden (£644m) combined. Most of that (£4 billion) has gone to tech firms in London -- well ahead of Paris (£1.14bn), Berlin (£814m) and Stockholm (£542m).

			     <p> Dublin’s Docklands area is now known as Silicon Docks. The clue’s in the name. It’s here that a host of major players in the tech and digital spheres have set up shop. Reeling off just a few is like a who’s who: Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft, Apple, Airbnb – they all have offices here. But it’s not just the household names. Dublin is attracting start-ups too, as smaller, innovative firms forego London or New York and call Ireland home instead. Why so? Here are four reasons.

<p> The Swedish capital placed high on the latest ranking of the world’s best EdTech environments. Among the listed 20 cities it came in 10th place and was the only Nordic city on the list.
	
As expected megacities such as Beijing, China, and Bay Area in Silicon Valley, USA, tops the list. One of the reasons that Stockholm placed above cities like Berlin, Germany, is the Swedish governmental innovation agency, Vinnova. The agency has financed over 60 companies during the last year, of which many are located in Stockholm.

"Stockholm is a challenger with his tenth position on the list. Despite its small size, Stockholm places itself among the international megacities, much thanks to a high degree of innovation and a growing ecosystem that supports the industry, not least on a Nordic level," Tim Praill, strategic chief of Navitas and head of Navitas Ventures, explains.

<p>Although London, Paris and Stockholm also claim to the title, the numbers make a strong case for Berlin these days. A key figure is that Berlin enjoyed a 9 percent jump in startups between 2015 and mid-2017, the highest percentage of any European city, according to the business credit-rating company Creditsafe. Similarly, Ernst & Young reported that 2017 was a banner year for Berlin's startups. Investment in German startups soared 88 percent last year to $4.3 billion, and the capital city accounted for a whopping 70 percent of the total.</p>

			Part of the appeal of tech hubs is that they provide affordable shared office space,

                     South Korea’s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth over the last half a decade,

                     First, the increasing visibility of successful startups has drawn attention from the public and inspired a younger 
					 generation of entrepreneurs. The Forbes list of wealthiest Koreans, long the domain of family-controlled conglomerates 
					 (or ‘chaebol’), is now peppered with gaming company founders worth billions of dollars. More recently, companies like TicketMonster,
					 Kakao (makers of KakaoTalk) and Coupang have shown strength not only by financial prowess, but also by penetrating a much broader segment 
					 of society with their products. Last year, the influence of the startup community was seared in the minds of the public when Ahn Chul Soo, 
					 founder of anti-virus company Ahnlab, ran for the country’s highest office.<br><br>

					China might have a very well established web industry, but it’s still a rough ride for Chinese startups. <br>
					There’s little in the way of government support. <br>
					There are strong web portals and companies out there that could easily and quickly clone a startup’s key product.<br>
                    There’s a great startup ecosystem from the idea stage right up to major follow-up funding. <br>
					At the base are startup events like Startup Weekends and Barcamps in cities like Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai occurring very often. <br>
                    There are strong funding interests in China from a wide variety of sources. <br>
					Interest in e-commerce seems strongest, with anyone from Sequoia Ventures to GGV Capital to California’s Bluerun Ventures being 
					especially keen on innovative e-stores. Social is a tougher area – hard to monetize, and easy to copy – for all but a few lucky ones. <br>
					With e-commerce in China was set to be worth a total of $177 billion in 2013, it’s little wonder that a lot of startups are trying out this business avenue.<br>
                    For incubation and acceleration, the largest is Innovation Works, created by Taiwanese-American Lee Kaifu, which is incubating over 
					50 startups that are now estimated to be wealth over $600 million. It can do series A funding as well as seed-stage. Aside from that,

                       The one thing that strikes most outsiders about the technology startup ecosystem in India is how diverse it is.
                       <ul>
					   <li>Entrepreneurs range from 21-year old college students to 61-year old executives, and it takes all types in between.</li>
					   <li>The anatomy of the “average” Indian technology entrepreneur is a 30+ year old male, with some technology background,
						focusing on building a product that’s largely trying to solve local (Indian) problems.</li>


                       <li>On average about 970 technology-product entities get started each year in India and only about 380 actually incorporate
					   the entity as a corporation. </li>
					   <li>The mortality rate is fairly high, with over 60 percent of these “entities” pivoting or going dormant within 12 to 18 months.</li>

					   <li>An equal number of services (consulting) entities get started each year in the technology space as well, which tend to last longer.</li>

                       <li>The startups are a good mix of 61 percent focused on business oriented offerings and about 39 percent on consumer applications such as mobile apps,
					   social networks and e-commerce offerings and others. </li>

                       <li>Over 80 angel investor networks, seed funds, accelerators and early stage funds, and over 153 companies get some form of
					   institutional funding each year.</li>

					   Idea stage (Open Coffee Club, Startup Saturday) - prototype stage (HasGeek, Startup Weekend)
					   Ready stage (DEMO India, Unpluggd) - the growth stage (NASSCOM product conclave, Reverse Pitch)

                       <li>There are three main challenges that the Indian technology ecosystem faces:</li>
					   <ul><li> paucity of exits</li><li>lack of a sophisticated angel investor and mentor ecosystem</li>
					   <li>inherent risk-averse nature of the Indian middle class</li></ul>
                       <li>confidence that metrics and trends will point to 300 percent to 500 percent growth in both startups and success in the next five
					   years.</li>

                  Whatever could be said about fast emerging economies in Asia, has been said about Myanmar. 
				  From the “next Thailand” to the “next Tiger”, Myanmar’s ascent to public prominence has been driven 
				  by the rapid adoption of mobile technology and internet, a young progressive population and a flood of 
				  foreign money. Is Yangon overhyped or is the startup buzz there real? We’re heading to Myanmar in September to find out.

                     With the effort put in by the Malaysian government under the National Alliance (Barisan Nasional) to collectively 
					 push Malaysia towards the high income nation model, technology will play a pivotal role in the Economic Transformation Program (ETP) 
					 spearheaded by Malaysia’s sixth Prime Minister Najib Razak.<br>
                     Malaysia has come a long way since the introduction of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) where technology companies made full use of

					 Grants incorporate professional advisers - which are great for guiding the hopeful startups right from the word go.</li><li>
                     A developer league has also been created which offer grants and contracts. Works as hackathons plus incubation. This is also supported by universities and telecoms.</li><li>
                     Recent successful startups: TeratoTech. </li><li>

                          With one of the youngest and largest populations in the world, Jakarta has all the demographic ingredients to make a great startup capital – but does it deliver? Jakarta has always struggled with infrastructure compared to its more developed neighbors but perhaps this is the stuff that yields innovative solutions (like GoJek) that can take on bigger markets abroad. We’re heading to Jakarta in September to find out more about the Indonesian startup scene.
                       </p>
                      <p>
					 In Indonesia people use their personal money as seed funding, then create a startup and it has to be making money from day one to survive. 
					 There’s no government funding for startups, so the startups built in Indonesia are mostly practical, like e-commerce, travel, and logistics. 
					 Innovation is something we think about later.<br><br>
                     In 2010, around 30 startup founders gathered in a Starbucks to discuss their startups and surprisingly it was one of the most important moments
					 for the Indonesian startup scene. The meetup became regular with specific topics; because it was started from Twitter, so the organization is 
					 called #StartupLokal. <br><br>
					 Now there are more than 200 people per meetup and thousands subscribed it.<br><br>
                     It is a favorable time to start a startup in Indonesia because it is politically stable, freedom of speech is a way of life, there is a rising middle 
					 class (up to 45 million people in Indonesia now have strong buying power), the penetration rate of mobile phones is extremely high 
					 with the average Indonesian having more than two mobile phones; there are 47 million Facebook users and very active Twitter users; and last but not least,
					 the biggest asset is that more than 60 percent of Indonesia’s 240 million population are under 35 years old with a median age of 28 spread 
					 across more than 17,000 islands in Indonesia.<br><br>
					 It’s a young country with so much room to explore and so many problems to solve, which means more opportunities for entrepreneurs.<br><br>
                     More investors are coming to Indonesia from all over the world, and more incubators available and they’re ready to invest. But most of them find 
					 difficulties to get a startup with a $1 million dream. So now the homework for Indonesian startup founders is to change the usual mindset, 
					 aim higher and think global.<br><br>
                     There are quite a few investors in Indonesia these days, including Merah Putih Incubator, GDP Venture, East Ventures, GREE Ventures, Grupara, Ideosource, and Cyber Agent Ventures.

                      <p>Japan is one of the more mature markets in the region, and it’s got big influential hits that shape the region.<br>
					  The center of all the activity is in Tokyo. But gone are the days when big guys like Hitachi, Sony, Fujitsu, and Panasonic are the rising stars (with Japan struggling economically, and hardware alone being less of a factor for consumers) and new players are on the scene now, with folks like GREE, DeNA, and Rakuten looking increasingly global and influential. If you want a quick look at the local scene, take a click over to our friends at Startup Dating and you’ll see a particularly vibrant ecosystem of business, VCs, and incubators.
                         On top of the big startup successes, Japan’s education system is particularly supportive, with incubators like Open Network Lab attempting YC-like startup acceleration. You can check out a full comprehensive list of incubators and accelerators in Japan here.
                         On the other hand, the problems that Japanese startups face are difficult: a relatively low-risk culture, with high rent costs, and a small ecosystem. But despite all this, big successes do manage to peek through and the government has been very supportive in setting up incubators – there are more than 300 across the country today.

                   CyberAgent Ventures, the new Japanese VC firm - is still investing<br>
                   The gouvernment has been contribuing by building industrial parks on the outskirts of the city and encouraging start-ups.
                   This has created strong and vibrant communitites of start-ups and developper people.<br>

                   The momentum of the startup scene in Vietnam has
                   been happening organically through the community and huge companies like FPT, VC Corp, and VNG leveraging the size of their infrastructures and markets.<br>
                   Thinking globally though, has not been part of many of Vietnam’s startups view until recently. Medium -size start-ups have strong business models but based on the market in Vietnam.<br>
                   A common startup model you will see in Vietnam is a subsidized kind. This has allowed some startups to avoid getting investor money but is sometimes a barrier to true product innovation.<br>

                        <p>There has never been a more interesting way to put up your own product or tech-service as a Philippines startup.
                     Early seed-stage investors include Kickstart (investments ranging from $30,000 to $120,000), Launchgarage, Ideaspace (investments of 12,500), SeedAsia -recent investor <br>
                     Government backed incubator/seed-stage funding options available from UP TBI/ Enterprise TBI/ DOST TBI – TBI. <br>
                     Possible investors - Global Gateway Ventures, Narra Ventures, ICCP Ventures, and Plug and Play<br>
                     Option to raise money internationally - like Kalibbr and Payroll Hero <br>

                     Online communities on Facebook such as StartupPH, coupled with several meetups such as Roofcamp, Open Coffee Wednesday, Founder’s Drink, and MobileMonday<br>
                     Startup events such as Startup Weekend, AngelHack, and the near-weekly developers’ bootcamps for almost every language available on the web.<br>

                    Philippines has a very large English speaking market in Asia outside of India.<br>
                    Philippines was not affected by the financial crisis of 1998 and 2007.<br>

                    Downside : there exists a gap between seed and series A investors in the Philippines and that limits the number of possible exits.<br>
                    E-commerce visibility is still in its early stages. Fewer than 10 percent of the total population have access to credit cards.<br>
                    Government still governs all e-commerce businesses with the same bureaucratic and cumbersome processes that isn’t very business friendly for entrepreneurs or investors - but it's possible to change ni the future.<br>
