					  There’s no arguing about it: Miami belongs to Latin America as much as it belongs to the US. In this context, it is hardly surprising to see startups open offices in Miami to target the Latin American market. To give only a couple of examples, this is the case of two companies we have reviewed over the last few months: the language learning platform OpenEnglish and the music service Senzari.
<br>
Interestingly, the connection also works the other way around. As the Miami-based angel investor Marco Giberti pointed out in the interview we published recently, targeting the US Hispanic market can be a good strategy for Latin American startups to crack the US market, and Miami a good starting point for US expansion.
<br>
In other words, Miami is a powerful bridge between the US and Latin America – and New York City will have to keep up its efforts if it wants to challenge this position.

					  As we reported, Recife has long established itself as a talent pool for the global tech industry, thanks to its universities’ world-class computer science departments. Over the last decade, the city has also been working on ways to retain this talent and stop the brain drain, while attracting foreign professionals.
<br>
The key to accomplish this goal is called C.E.S.A.R, which is the Brazilian acronym for “Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems.” Created 15 years ago by university teachers, it has turned into Brazil’s most innovative tech institution. In addition to helping big companies develop new ideas through open innovation, it also incubates its own startup projects, such as green tech company Silicon Reef.
<br>
More recently, C.E.S.A.R has also become part of a larger initiative, the tech cluster Porto Digital, which plays host to 143 companies and 6,500 IT professionals. If this wasn’t enough to put Recife on the map, the city also recently hosted a Startup Weekend, and is now gearing up for its Campus Party.

					  Rio de Janeiro is not only one of the most naturally beautiful cities in the world; it is also becoming a serious São Paulo challenger when it comes to Internet startups. While Rio’s natural assets aren’t new, the city has been increasingly attracting attention over the last few months.
<br><br>
More importantly, this trend is likely to persist at least until 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. As a result, Cisco chose Rio as the base for its new innovation center, which is part of its $570m investment in Brazil, while IBM is helping Rio’s city hall to manage its impressive operations center.
<br><br>
Yet this isn’t only about happy accidents, and local forces have also made considerable efforts to give the city’s tech scene a boost. New and high-quality accelerators have emerged, such as 21212, which also has offices in New York, but also 100% Rio-based Polo Marte, VentureOne and Startup Rio – not to mention other initiatives that are currently in the works.
<br><br>
In addition to Startup Weekend, regular networking events have also blossomed, for instance Startup Rio Meetup, which has expanded to other cities, as well as Geeks on Beer, which is organized by the same group which is also managing Rio’s main co-working space, BeesOffice.

					  It is no accident that we chose São Paulo as the destination for the first TNW Conference Latin America next August. As the research firm Fnbox reported, the GDP of the state of São Paulo is bigger than Argentina’s, Chile’s, Uruguay’s, Bolivia’s and Paraguay’s combined, despite the fact that it is less than 5% the size of those countries.
<br><br>
In this context, São Paulo is arguably the place to be for startups keen to tap its huge local market or use it as a base to target Brazil in its entirety, while partnering with the vast number of local and foreign companies which have offices in this huge city.
<br><br>
It is also the best location to raise money from its many investors and banks, as well as from foreign VC funds such as Sequoia and Flybridge, which tend to choose the city as their point of entry into Latin America. In addition, the city also hosts a vast number of networking events and hackathons, as well as several co-working spaces.
<br><br>
As a result, São Paulo has one of the busiest startup ecosystems of Latin America, and there are way to many promising startups to name them all – but you will definitely get a chance to meet them at TNW Conference.

                     South Korea’s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth over the last half a decade, 
					 with a proliferation of not only ventures but also of accelerators and VCs. Casting a glance across the startup space, 
					 two main reasons for this growth are apparent.<br><br>
                     First, the increasing visibility of successful startups has drawn attention from the public and inspired a younger 
					 generation of entrepreneurs. The Forbes list of wealthiest Koreans, long the domain of family-controlled conglomerates 
					 (or ‘chaebol’), is now peppered with gaming company founders worth billions of dollars. More recently, companies like TicketMonster,
					 Kakao (makers of KakaoTalk) and Coupang have shown strength not only by financial prowess, but also by penetrating a much broader segment 
					 of society with their products. Last year, the influence of the startup community was seared in the minds of the public when Ahn Chul Soo, 
					 founder of anti-virus company Ahnlab, ran for the country’s highest office.<br><br>
                     Second, the Korean government has shown tremendous support for the startup community, a trend that looks set to continue following the recent presidential race. Ahn eventually dropped out, and Korea elected its first female president, Park Geun Hye, who included increased venture financing as one of her campaign pledges. South Korea already boasted the fourth largest VC market in the world (with only the 17th largest economy), but venture financing looks to hit new highs when government programs kick in this summer.
                     That said, entrepreneurs report that applications for government funding have tapered off this year as the typical high failure rates of start-ups start to crystallize trepidation in the minds of graduating seniors. Throughout the world, most startups fail, but unlike in Silicon Valley where failure implies learning, in Korea, as in most Asian countries, failure implies inadequacy.
                     This fear of failure and other cultural characteristics of Korean companies could be barriers in going global, the next challenge for Korean startups. But conglomerates like Samsung, gaming companies like Nexon, and K-pop groups like Big Bang have encountered similar barriers before and yet succeeded in spreading the Korean brand beyond the borders of the hermit kingdom. With continued visibility and government support, we could see the same for the next generation of startup founders.
                     Incidentally, ‘the Korean startup scene’ typically refers to the South, but North Korea has also seen a surge in entrepreneurial activity in the last half decade. Though no traditional incubators exist in the DPRK, the Choson Exchange has started a ‘Women in Business’ program to train female entrepreneurs in the country, and brought five North Koreans to Singapore for a one month internship at a startup incubator. In a time of increasing tensions, perhaps the peninsula could benefit from some startup statecraft.</a>

					China might have a very well established web industry, but it’s still a rough ride for Chinese startups. <br>
					There’s little in the way of government support. <br>
					There are strong web portals and companies out there that could easily and quickly clone a startup’s key product.<br>
                    There’s a great startup ecosystem from the idea stage right up to major follow-up funding. <br>
					At the base are startup events like Startup Weekends and Barcamps in cities like Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai occurring very often. <br>
                    There are strong funding interests in China from a wide variety of sources. <br>
					Interest in e-commerce seems strongest, with anyone from Sequoia Ventures to GGV Capital to California’s Bluerun Ventures being 
					especially keen on innovative e-stores. Social is a tougher area – hard to monetize, and easy to copy – for all but a few lucky ones. <br>
					With e-commerce in China was set to be worth a total of $177 billion in 2013, it’s little wonder that a lot of startups are trying out this business avenue.<br>
                    For incubation and acceleration, the largest is Innovation Works, created by Taiwanese-American Lee Kaifu, which is incubating over 
					50 startups that are now estimated to be wealth over $600 million. It can do series A funding as well as seed-stage. Aside from that, 
					there’s Tisiwi in Hangzhou, and the soon-to-be-rebranded Chinaccelerator up in Dalian.<br>

                     Rafael Wong Chi Hao and Casey Lau: Hong Kong was rated one of the world’s top four tech capitals to watch after star-studded Silicon Valley and New York in a recent Forbes’ article. Despite the lack of a startup ecosystem in the early to mid-noughties, Hong Kong’s economic focus on traditional industries such as real estate, a lack of investors looking at tech, and a lack of computer science talent graduating from local universities, Hong Kong’s startup culture is brewing. In the past two to three years, co-working spaces like CoCoon, The Hive Hong Kong, The Good Lab, and BootHK are flourishing to bring in an enormous amount of foreign tech talents. Startup breeding grounds such as Startup Weekend, AcceleratorHK, the Make A Difference Venture Fellows Program, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Incubation Program, and StartupsHK are up and running to set Hong Kong in the right direction towards promoting entrepreneurship.
                     A partial list of Hong Kong-based startups can be found here and updates on what is happening in the local scene can be found on the StartupsHK blog along with a full calendar. Also, here’s a resource page of incubators, funds, and job sites for startups in Hong Kong.
                     The next stage, therefore, is for Hong Kong to develop a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem where startups and investors exist, the startup industry will grow naturally. So the big difficult question is how?

                       The one thing that strikes most outsiders about the technology startup ecosystem in India is how diverse it is.

						focusing on building a product that’s largely trying to solve local (Indian) problems.</li>
						
					
                       <li>On average about 970 technology-product entities get started each year in India and only about 380 actually incorporate 
					   the entity as a corporation. </li>
					   <li>The mortality rate is fairly high, with over 60 percent of these “entities” pivoting or going dormant within 12 to 18 months.</li>
					   
					   <li>An equal number of services (consulting) entities get started each year in the technology space as well, which tend to last longer.</li>
					   
                       <li>The startups are a good mix of 61 percent focused on business oriented offerings and about 39 percent on consumer applications such as mobile apps,
					   social networks and e-commerce offerings and others. </li>
					   
                       <li>Over 80 angel investor networks, seed funds, accelerators and early stage funds, and over 153 companies get some form of 
					   institutional funding each year.</li>
                       
					   Idea stage (Open Coffee Club, Startup Saturday) - prototype stage (HasGeek, Startup Weekend) 
					   Ready stage (DEMO India, Unpluggd) - the growth stage (NASSCOM product conclave, Reverse Pitch)
					   
                       <li>There are three main challenges that the Indian technology ecosystem faces:</li>
					   <ul><li> paucity of exits</li><li>lack of a sophisticated angel investor and mentor ecosystem</li>
					   <li>inherent risk-averse nature of the Indian middle class</li></ul>
                       <li>confidence that metrics and trends will point to 300 percent to 500 percent growth in both startups and success in the next five

                          With one of the youngest and largest populations in the world, Jakarta has all the demographic ingredients to make a great startup capital – but does it deliver? Jakarta has always struggled with infrastructure compared to its more developed neighbors but perhaps this is the stuff that yields innovative solutions (like GoJek) that can take on bigger markets abroad. We’re heading to Jakarta in September to find out more about the Indonesian startup scene.
                       </p>


                     Aulia “Ollie” Halimatussadiah: When I was at a tech conference, someone asked me if my startup’s already making money. I said, “Of course. I can’t afford not to!” That also describes most bootstrapping startups in Indonesia. We use our personal money as seed funding, then we create a startup and it has to be making money from day one to survive. There’s no government funding for startups, so the startups built in Indonesia are mostly practical, like e-commerce, travel, and logistics. Innovation is something we think about later.
                     In 2010, around 30 startup founders gathered in a Starbucks to discuss their startups and surprisingly it was one of the most important moments for the Indonesian startup scene. The meetup became regular with specific topics; because it was started from Twitter, so the organization is called #StartupLokal. Natali Ardianto, Nuniek Tirta and I organize every monthly meetup. Now there are more than 200 people per meetup and thousands subscribed to our mailing list.
                     It is a favorable time to start a startup in Indonesia because we’re politically stable, freedom of speech is a way of life, we have a rising middle class (up to 45 million people in Indonesia now have strong buying power), the penetration rate of mobile phones is extremely high with the average Indonesian having more than two mobile phones; we have 47 million Facebook users and very active Twitter users; and last but not least, our biggest asset is that more than 60 percent of Indonesia’s 240 million population are under 35 years old with a median age of 28 spread across more than 17,000 islands in Indonesia. It’s a young country with so much room to explore and so many problems to solve, which means more opportunities for entrepreneurs.
                     More investors are coming to Indonesia from all over the world, and more incubators available and they’re ready to invest. But most of them find difficulties to get a startup with a $1 million dream. So now the homework for Indonesian startup founders is to change the usual mindset, aim higher and think global.
                     There are quite a few investors in Indonesia these days, including Merah Putih Incubator, GDP Venture, East Ventures, GREE Ventures, Grupara, Ideosource, and Cyber Agent Ventures.

                      <p>Japan is one of the more mature markets in the region, and it’s got big influential hits that shape the region.<br>
					  The center of all the activity is in Tokyo. But gone are the days when big guys like Hitachi, Sony, Fujitsu, and Panasonic are the rising stars (with Japan struggling economically, and hardware alone being less of a factor for consumers) and new players are on the scene now, with folks like GREE, DeNA, and Rakuten looking increasingly global and influential. If you want a quick look at the local scene, take a click over to our friends at Startup Dating and you’ll see a particularly vibrant ecosystem of business, VCs, and incubators.
                         On top of the big startup successes, Japan’s education system is particularly supportive, with incubators like Open Network Lab attempting YC-like startup acceleration. You can check out a full comprehensive list of incubators and accelerators in Japan here.
                         On the other hand, the problems that Japanese startups face are difficult: a relatively low-risk culture, with high rent costs, and a small ecosystem. But despite all this, big successes do manage to peek through and the government has been very supportive in setting up incubators – there are more than 300 across the country today.

                          Not only listed as the hottest capital in the world weather-wise, Bangkok could also be the hottest city in the world startup-wise. While we haven’t had any big exits yet, Thailand is a hotbed of startup talent – from local founders opting to do their own thing outside of their family businesses to a growing population of location independent entrepreneurs and digital nomads.
                       </p>
                     Prathan Thananart: The explosion of the startup scene in Bangkok over last year can be characterized by three related trends. First is the momentum building done by tech events over last several years through a series of BarCamps, Mobile Mondays, and Startup Weekends. These events, and success stories shared by entrepreneurs from local and abroad, send the message that startup entrepreneurs aren’t a fringe group anymore.
                     Second, the rise of co-working spaces is interesting to note since they were once predicted by many to never take off due to the solid member base they would need to sustain operation. Now there are several healthy ones throughout Bangkok, and they help connect entrepreneurs to developers and freelancers in the industry.
                     Finally, the establishment of venture capital firms and business angel groups, including expansion from firms based in other Asian countries. Prominent ones include InVent, owned by Intouch, which also operate the largest telco in Thailand, and Ardent Capital, run by the investors of Ensogo which sold to LivingSocial.
                     A downside of the scene we have here is that it’s not very diverse. Last I counted there are 10+ companies competing in the loyalty app space, and countless group buying clones. Chances are, as we mature, some of this energy will be channeled into other less tapped spaces. Just like how Tel Aviv, with its famous traffic jams, gave birth to Waze, the navigator app with crowdsourced congestion data.
                     Bangkok is home to millions of smartphone owners and over 18 million social media users from a web user-base of 25 million. And as the digitally native, younger population grows up, there is bound to be plenty of disruption to how people shop, commute, and stay in touch.

					 Venture capital landscape has been exciting but drying up in some places.<br>
                   DFJ Vina Capital and IDG Ventures - are slowly leaving.<br>
                   CyberAgent Ventures, the new Japanese VC firm - is still investing<br>
                   The gouvernment has been contribuing by building industrial parks on the outskirts of the city and encouraging start-ups.
                   This has created strong and vibrant communitites of start-ups and developper people.<br>

                   The momentum of the startup scene in Vietnam has
                   been happening organically through the community and huge companies like FPT, VC Corp, and VNG leveraging the size of their infrastructures and markets.<br>
                   Thinking globally though, has not been part of many of Vietnam’s startups view until recently. Medium -size start-ups have strong business models but based on the market in Vietnam.<br>
                   A common startup model you will see in Vietnam is a subsidized kind. This has allowed some startups to avoid getting investor money but is sometimes a barrier to true product innovation.<br>
